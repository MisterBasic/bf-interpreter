An interpreter for Brainf**k

This interpreter is pretty weak, and isn't the best for interpreting Brainf**k (BF) code.
It does contain a compression algorithm, since BF instructions are incredibly huge.

I would advise you use a different interpreter, and if you choose to use this one, it might break.

If you want to learn more about BF, you can go to [esolangs.org](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck), they have a good explaination of what this incredibly funny language is.
